## I can't draw. Sometimes it's a problem.

I can't draw. I have never had a talent for it. Which is not such a bummer, drawing is something that you can learn. But I never had the motivation to do it, nor did I prioritize it high enough to find time for it. That was not a problem so far. Until recently, the only benefit for me that I could think of would be slightly better chances in Activity when it's my turn to draw a word.  

But that changed last week.


## Drawings are a good presents

A friend of mine turned 30. Like me, he is sporty and a cool dude to hang out with. However, unlike me, he has a big talent for drawing. And he does so frequently. In our circle of friends, he is renowned for his paintings. They are all over the place in his place. And they make handy presents for every one of his friends that has something to celebrate.

So naturally, we decided to turn the tables and make something artsy for his birthday. The idea was that everyone draws a picture of the birthday boy - or something that is associated with him - on a post-it. Afterwards, we take all post-its, put them together, and frame the resulting masterpiece.

## Nice idea. Now execute.

Sounds like a nice idea. One problem though: when I started drawing the birthday boy, I realized pretty fast that my drawing skills are even worse than I thought. This put me in a dilemma: I was already late for submitting my drawing to the compiler - which in this case has nothing to do with computer science, it's the person putting everything together and framing it as the final masterpiece. There was no time to read articles about how to draw, no time to practice, no time to ask a friend and no time to try a dozen times. The clock was ticking!

## ChatGPT to the rescue

That was when I had a realization: ChatGPT helped me with so much recently, be it coding, writing, or researching. Why not use it to help me draw? My first idea was to let Dall-E create a picture and print it. But besides not having a printer at home - after all, I'm not a boomer - this would send a big middle finger to the birthday boy. Like "I value our friendship so little, I don't even try to put in some effort and make it personal." Thus, I decided to just use Dall-E as a drawing instructor. After fiddling around with the prompt, I got the desired result: an easy to draw image, where copying lay even in reach for my dismal drawing skills. The magic prompt engineering feat turned out to instruct it to draw an icon. In lieu of that, Dall-E attempts to include shades and all other sorts of "tricky" drawing besides telling it not to.

Here is what ChatGPT gave me:

It still took me two attempts to get it right, but the result - while still mediocre for someone that can actually draw - is by far better than my first draft. Check for yourself:

Like I said, not perfect, but definitely a big improvement. A pencil instead of a pen would have helped. And a little bit more time would have yielded even better results, but unfortunately, ChatGPT is not able to manipulate time. Yet ;)

## Aftermath: My first follower

After the gift-handover at the party, I talked to one friend that was not in town to contribute his picture prior to the party. And on top of that, he thinks of his drawing skills as much as I think of mine. When we were talking about how cool the present turned out to be, I told him how I used ChatGPT to hack my drawing skills. Always eager to try out new things, he used the same approach. And even improved it to make it a "1-shot" experience as in not needing a second attempt like I did: he simply put the post-it directly on his phone screen, making it way easier to copy the Dall-E picture. A nice improvement - I hope with time more will follow.

Even though I still wouldn't say I'm good at drawing, I will do it more often: it adds a personal touch to every gift, making even mundane things more special. And thanks to ChatGPT the result is not embarrassing anymore.


## Try it out! 

Drawing pictures as a present or to personalize presents is a niche thing. But I think it should be more common. So I encourage you to try it out yourself - use ChatGPT with Dall-E, midjourney or any of the other image generation AIs to hack your drawing skills from today onwards. Experiment with prompts and create yourself a digital drawing instructor that caters to your level. And if you are too lazy for that: here is a [GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-mg5HbMtj8-help-me-draw) that fast-tracks it for you.
