"A Promised Land" is the first part of the autobiography by Barack Obama. This work gives the reader a deep insight into the career of the first non-white President of the USA.

For me, particularly captivating are the detailed descriptions of the considerations and processes that led to the most significant decisions of his term. These include the rescue operations for banks and companies during the 2008 economic crisis, the introduction of a new health insurance - known as "Obamacare" - and the elimination of Osama Bin Laden.

Obama himself describes his actions as driven by a deep belief in the American dream and the promise upon which America was founded. In the book, he repeatedly shows the necessity of compromises and explains how disagreements between people can be bridged to bring about significant changes.

## The Beginnings
Obama's path changed significantly when he went from an average student to a curious bookworm. Frustrated by the pure theory at an elite university, he decides to follow up with practical deeds and becomes a community organizer in a troubled Chicago neighborhood.

But even here, to his taste, he can make too little difference, as he can only improve things for a small group of people he cares for. Therefore, he decides early on as a State Senator, roughly comparable to an Austrian regional parliament member, to go into politics.

## A Black President?
Despite some political setbacks, such as his failed election as a Congressman, he decides to run for U.S. Senator. However, he makes a compromise with his wife Michelle. She sees Barack Obama's political career as a great burden for the family, which she actually does not want to continue. Therefore, the two agree that if he fails, he will end his political career. But the risk pays off, and Obama becomes Senator for the state of Illinois.

His actual breakthrough comes in 2004 when he delivers a historic keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention, known as "The Audacity of Hope" (in German "Die Kühnheit der Hoffnung"). With this speech, he becomes known nationwide and for many a symbol of hope, especially for all those who, because of their skin color and the associated discrimination, do not believe in themselves.

Here is a quote from the eponymous part of this speech (not reproduced in the book as such):
> "Hope – Hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope! In the end, that is God’s greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation. A belief in things not seen. A belief that there are better days ahead."

Obama uses this fame to start his initially rather hopeless presidential candidacy. He then pursues a very successful strategy with the intensive use of then-new social media, the creation of a grassroots movement, and massive support from small donors. Thus, he first beats the favored Hillary Clinton in the primary and then the Republican John McCain in the presidential election.

## Decision Processes
Obama places great emphasis on the process of decision-making. He always underscores the importance of carefully weighing alternatives and considering dissenting voices. During the economic crisis inherited from his predecessor, he faces many "plague-or-cholera decisions": Often, he is forced by circumstances to make decisions that he himself does not find ideal, such as that bank CEOs and other crisis culprits must bear far too little negative consequences for their mistakes. Thanks to the book, I can understand his decisions at the time to deal with the Wall Street giants much better. Personally, this was always a decision by Obama that I saw rather negatively. Because from a liberal point of view, it is quite clear that everyone, regardless of power and influence, must take responsibility for their mistakes.

In his decisions to carry out the withdrawal from Iraq on the one hand and to reinforce troops in Afghanistan on the other, his careful decision-making becomes clear, which at first glance may seem paradoxical. Obama's surprise at receiving the Nobel Peace Prize and his awareness that even a Nobel Peace Prize laureate must start wars, for example, to prevent massacres in Libya or Iraq, show his complex view of leadership responsibility.

## Fundamental Opposition and Irrelevant News
In the book, Obama clearly describes his frustration with the political polarization that has led to a standstill in Washington. Despite an initial clear majority in both chambers, the Obama administration decided not to act too partisanly to leave room for compromise. Nevertheless, the Republicans refused any cooperation and adopted a uncompromising line enforced by their leader, Senator McConnell, with a heavy hand. He puts cooperative Republicans under considerable pressure until they cease any cooperation with the Democrats. In doing so, the Republican leadership can count on the support of an increasingly radicalized base and strategic major donors from the far right.

On the other hand, Obama also addresses the role of the media, which often focuses on completely unimportant topics, such as "Pin-Gate" – Obama had temporarily not worn a pin with the American flag on his jacket during the campaign – and other artificially inflated "scandals". He laments the great attention given to absurd conspiracy theories like the "Birther" movement. This was the clearly refutable claim that Obama was born in Kenya and not an American citizen. The "Birther" movement would later prove to be an important springboard for the presidency of Obama's successor, Donald Trump.

## Recommendation
Overall, "A Promised Land" by Barack Obama presents itself as a fascinating book, particularly suitable for sharpening the understanding that decisions in politics are often more complex and difficult than they may appear at first glance. Critically, it can be noted that – as with most autobiographies written by the subjects themselves – this book makes many things appear much more effortless than they were in reality.

For fans of the book, "Becoming" and "The Light We Carry" by Michelle Obama are recommended, which describe her experiences in the White House from the perspective of the First Lady.
